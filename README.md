# send_to_kindle
 send an ebook to my kindle
this works with the telegram bot @allotherusernamesweretaken_bot.The purpose of the code is to search for the particular book you entered into the telegram bot, download it, change it to a kindle format and send it to your kindle for you to enjoy. te exact command on how you can search for the book is provided in the telegram bot itself.

the video file of the test shows how it works on my laptop, but actual implementation will be on a personal server.

if you wish to use this code for your projects, kindly change the api key to the one from your telegram bot, and similarly change the emails as the application might be.
